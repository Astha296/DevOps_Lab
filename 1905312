I have my best teaching experience with auribises and Mr. Ishant Sir in the last one month. The way and level of knowledge they share is highly commendable. I have learnt a lot and I wish auribises will see far more success in future.
The director is not only a highly experienced corporate trainer, but is a very great human being.
I have had the privilege of getting trained from him.
Not only did I start my programming career here, but also found the zeal of excelling in the Software Engineering field from my trainer-cum-mentor!
Surely the standalone place in Ludhiana if you are looking o get ready for Software Engineering
